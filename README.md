# Phishing-detection-using-decision-tree-classifier-and-XGBoost

This is a phishing links detection using the data set from Kaggle. I've used decision tree classifier and XGBoost to train the model with 75% accuracy. 

The data set can't be uploaded, just message me if you want a copy.

This is created using Jupyter notebook.
